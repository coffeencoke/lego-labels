# Contributing

1. To capture lego brick images, use [Lego Studio from Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page).
   1. Add images to `src/images/pending` if not yet added to a label
2. Import them via drag-and-drop using the template located in `src/templates/`
3. Add final docs in `dist/`
   1. Move images to `src/iamges/labeled` after they've been added to a label in `dist/`
4. Send your update as a PR in github.

## Conventions

I like to have all of the labels consistent, so please use the following guide:

1. Make labels centered on each label (easy to drag to align)
2. Make labels scaled down (easy to scale down in Pages with the slider)
3. Make bricks same color (currently using Blue)
4. For bricks with dimensions, annotate on the label (eg. 2x4, 2x6, etc).
5. Name your brick images categorically so they are easy to find later.
